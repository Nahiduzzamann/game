            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Play Responsibly</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>Playing at B0XBET should be something positive and entertaining, whilst also thrilling and fun. Sometimes 
            it is hard to control how much we want to play in relation to how much we can afford to lose.
             In this section you’ll find ways to help make sure your gambling is within controllable limits,
              as well as show you places to turn to if you feel you might require help.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>I Think I Might Be Playing Too Much</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>Below we have listed statements taken from a renowned psychological research paper.
             If you find that one or more of these statements are true for you, you might have a gambling problem and we 
             recommend that you seek professional help and see how B0XBET can help you deal with this problem in sections 
             3 and 4 below. You’ve repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. You’re restless or 
             irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. You gamble as a way of escaping from problems or of relieving 
             a dysphoric mood. You often return another day after losing money gambling, to get even (“chasing” one’s losses).
              You lie to family members, therapist, or others to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. You’ve committed
               illegal acts such as forgery, fraud, theft, or embezzlement to finance gambling. You’ve jeopardized or lost a significant relationship,
             job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling.
              You rely on others to provide money to relieve a desperate financial situation caused by gambling.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>I Think That A Friend, Or Someone In My Family Plays Too Much</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>Below there is a list of warning signals and signs. Does this remind you of someone you know? At “Read more
             and contact” you will find more information and contact details to professionals who work with gambling addiction.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Time</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>More and more time is used to gamble and plan around playing. The person is
             preoccupied more often and prioritises gambling over things that used to be more important in the person’s life.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Economy</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>Money disappears from accounts, the person is borrowing
             money more often without being able to pay back, the person can have money problems or trouble paying the bills, even with a steady income.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Mood</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>The person is more worried than usual, more easily irritated and shows several signs of depression and anxiety.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Behaviour</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>It is not unusual that the person is becoming isolated from friends and relatives and avoids social activities.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Set Your Limits And Play Responsibly</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>If you are concerned that sometimes you may play for more than you plan,
             we can offer you some helpful limits to set before you start playing. When setting your limit it will
              go into effect right away and start taking into account your activity from the time you set it. For example,
               should you set a weekly limit on Wednesday, it will reset midnight to Monday and then continue to run from Monday
                to Sunday. It takes 24 hours to revoke or ease up a limit.
             But if you decide to make a limit tighter, then the change is instant. You can activate the limit that suits you the best via your Play Ok settings here.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Spending Budget</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>This will limit the amount you can spend during a certain period. You will
             be able to make deposits up to the amount you have chosen and in addition to this, you can deposit an amount equal 
            to any withdrawals made during this period. If you set a budget of €50 weekly and withdraw €100 that same week,
             you will be able to deposit a total of €150.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Deposit Limit</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>This will limit the amount you can deposit during a certain period. Once you have reached
             this sum you will not be able to make any new deposits until your limit is reset.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Wager Limit</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>This will limit the total amount you can bet during a certain period.
             When you have reached this sum, you will not be able to place any new bets until your limit has reset.</p>
            
           <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Loss Limit</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>This will limit the possible amount of net losses you can make based on bets minus wins during a certain period. When you have reached this sum, 
            you will not be able to place any new bets until your limit is reset.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Logged In Time Limit</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>Limit how many hours you can be logged in to your account daily. Once you reach your limit, you will be automatically logged out and any gameplay
             is paused or completed in the background. ProTip: Make sure to always log out of your account when you finish your session.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Login Time Block</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>Set a specific time block covering all days of the week during which you will not be able to log in to your account.
             The start- and end time of this limit will calculate according to the time zone you are in when activating it.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Take A Break Or Stop Playing</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>Sometimes you might need a break from playing and you can suspend your account for a period of your choice.
             If you want a cool off period you can go for a shorter break. If you are concerned that you have been playing too much we recommend that
              you instead self-exclude your account for a minimum period of 6 months. When gambling has become a problem for you, however, 
            an indefinite exclusion from online gambling is the right choice for you. You can suspend your account via your Play Ok settings here.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Take A Break</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>You can take a break from B0XBET for up to 6 months. Once your break is over, your account will be automatically reopened.
             You will be able to make changes to the end date at a later time if you so choose. If you end it early,
             a 24 hour cool off period will apply before you can log in again. Speak with us in our chat if you need any advice. You will not receive any emails 
             or texts from us during this time.</p>

            <p className='font-bold pt-5 pb-2 underline underline-offset-5'>Self Exclusion</p>
            <p className='font-medium'>If you feel that you have been playing too much or are concerned that your gambling is becoming a problem,
             we recommend that you exclude your account for at least 6 months. You will not be able to return during this time and will not receive
              any emails or texts from us. Once your exclusion has expired your account will automatically reopen. Contact us in our live chat to let us
             know if you want to extend your exclusion. If gambling has become a problem for you, you should close your account indefinitely instead and seek professional help.</p>
